The score board accommodates as many players as you need (although some scrolling will be required if you play with more than 4). The image below shows the player count screen, where you input the amount of players for your game.

By default, the cards are named incrementally Player 1, Player 2 etc. You can name the cards to whatever you choose by tapping on the default names and entering a value.


Below you can see a game in action with named cards.
